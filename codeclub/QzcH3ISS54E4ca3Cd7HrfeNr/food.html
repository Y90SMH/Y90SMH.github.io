  <h2>What I want to be when I am older!</h2>
  <p>What I would love to be when I am older is a famous formula 1 racer like Lewis Hamilton because the things that I have at home is 437 hot wheels which is a lot in my opinion.</p>
  <p>All of my strokes perfect and all of my dives as strait and stream second job would My and be able to do be an Olympic swimmer, and win gold medals and trophies line as possible and if you are wondering what stream line is well it is when you cover your ears as tight as possible and you push of the wall and glide through the water like a rocket.</p>
  <p>I would also love to be a rally racer for red bull doing   crazy stunts like a back flip on the racing dirt bikes.</p>
