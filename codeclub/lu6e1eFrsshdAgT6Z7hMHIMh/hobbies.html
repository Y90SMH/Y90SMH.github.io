  <h1>My favourite hobbies to do</h1>
 
  <p> 
When I am board I love to do loom bands so far my favourite what I have made is a panda, a gymnast, a Christmas present, candy canes,  a backpack, an owl, a chicken and just normal bracelets and necklaces.  
</p>
  
  <p>
For one of my hobbies is dancing because I love to do it I do all different kinds of dancing and do competitions as well. At the minute I’m learning how to do a front flip what is very exciting.

  <p>I also love having sleepovers because me and my friends always love to do fun challenges like the beenboozled challenge the warhead challenge and just games and gymnastic competitions. We also like to make dances up and do shows for our parents. 
 </p>
  
  <p>One of my favourite things to do is laugh with my friends and family because it’s just so funny and when over people start laughing I laugh even more what is hilarious.                                                                                                                                     </p>
