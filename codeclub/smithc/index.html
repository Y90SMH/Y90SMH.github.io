		<p>Tangfastics are my absolute favourite sweets. They are made by the company called haribos which also make star mix. Yummy! Tangfastics have luxury sugar which makes it have a tangy taste!!!!</p>

		<p>You can suck Tangfastics till the fizzy sugar comes off. They can last for ages!!.
My favourite Tangfastics are cola bottles, watermelons, cherries and dummies which are the best for sucking!!</p>
