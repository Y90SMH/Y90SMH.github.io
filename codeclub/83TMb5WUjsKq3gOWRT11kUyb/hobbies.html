  <p>My hobbies are dancing, singing, musical theatre, running and art. Dancing is the most important to me, I have been going to Apple Dance since I was 2-3 years old. I love dancing, I do ballet, tap, modern, freestyle and hip-hop. Soon I am doing my ballet exam for grade 2, so I am hoping I will pass and go on grade 3.</p>

  <p>We are currently doing Matilda in Musical theatre, we had to audition for the rolls and I got the roll that I wantedâ€¦ I am playing Matilda! I am so excited about it and we are all working so hard to do this extremely hard choreography. I have been trying hard to learn my lines at home but there are a lot to learn. </p>
