  <p>In school my absolute favourite subjects have to be English, art, and games. I especially love English, I love doing poems. I also like art very much as well, we always love getting messy in class, but then the boring part is when we have to tidy up.</p>

  <p>Maths is a bit tricky though, so that is not one of my favourites but I still like it. In maths I like doing column addition and bodmass. I think it is really fun to do and it really gets me thinking. School is really fun but sometimes I donâ€™t really like it, but most of the time we are having fun.</p>
