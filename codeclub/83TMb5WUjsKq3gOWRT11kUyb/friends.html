  <p>My best friends have to be Anna, Neve, Tom, Emily, Maddison and Abigail. They are always there to support and they are so loyal and will always be my friends. Anna and Neve are the most important friends, Anna lives on my street and Neve I donâ€™t really get to see much because I have just moved house from Lowton to Newton-Le-Willows and I really miss her.</p>
