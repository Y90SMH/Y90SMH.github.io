  <p>.Warrington Wolves RLFC is a professional rugby league football club based in Warrington, England that competes in Super League. They play at the Halliwell Jones Stadium, having moved there from Wilderspool in 2003.
Warrington is one of the original twenty-two clubs that formed the  northen rugby union in 1895[2] and the only one that has played every season in the top flight. They are nicknamed "The Wire" in reference to the wire-pulling industry in the town.

The official foundation date for the club is given as 1879,[3] rugby football was certainly played in the town before that date and there was an earlier club bearing the same name. Under the heading 'Outdoor Sports â€“ Football' the Widnes Guardian of 25 January 1873 reports on a recent game between Warrington and Wigan  at the unnamed ground of the former. On 6 December 1873 that same newspaper carried details of a local derby between Warrington and Zingari and in subsequent weeks there were matches with Sale and Free Wanderers. Because surviving records from that era are fragmentary it is not possible to say with certainty what became of this Warrington club.</P>
