  <p>my favourite book is snow merchant by Sam Guyton And illustrated by Chris riddle its in 5 parts </p>
  <p>Lettie Peppercorn lives in a house on stilts near the wind-swept coast of Albion, with no one to talk to but Periwinkle the pigeon. Her days are filled with floor-sweeping, bed-making and soup-stirring. Her nights are filled with dreams of her mother, who vanished long ago. Nothing incredible has ever happened to Lettie, until one winter's night.
The night the Snow Merchant comes.
He claims to be an alchemist - the greatest that ever lived - and in a mahogany suitcase, he carries his newest invention.
    It is an invention that will change Lettie's life - and the world - forever.

The Snow Merchant is a fantasy filled with family secrets, magical transformations and wild adventure. </p>
  
  <p>The Snow Merchant tells the fantastically improbable yet delightful tale of a girl struggling to run a boarding house alone. One night a chilly guest offers her an amazing new invention – ‘snow’!  Why this should be of interest to Lettie is initially a mystery. As she and her new friend, Noah – a boy with a tree growing from his shoulder - pursue the con-man to bring about his downfall, they also track down her missing alchemist mother. In a  way, Sam Gaytan has created a light, fast-moving tale of how important it is to discover what’s really important in life.  The writing is detailed and humorous, creating effective pictures for the young imagination, although the intended age range will probably miss some of the best humour</p>
