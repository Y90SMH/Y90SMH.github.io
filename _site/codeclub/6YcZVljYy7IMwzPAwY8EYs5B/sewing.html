<p>Sewing a relaxing thing to do. It can keep you entertained for a few hours when you are board, thatâ€™s exactly what I do.
  <P>I like to make cushions with lots of patterns on as you can see below.

<P>What you need to make a fluffy, comfortable pillow:
<li>A sewing machine
<li>Some material of YOUR choice
<li>A colour of thread (black or white)
<li>White or black Velcro 
<li>16 inch pillow
<p>Tips: 
<P>Make sure you sew over the Velcro two or three times to make sure it is secure or else it will fall to bits.                                    <P>Trim all the straggly bits at the end.       
<p>Always have some fabric pins. 
  <P>Iron the fabric after you have finished.
