    <h2>The rules and points</h2>
    <p>I enjoy tennis as it is very active and fun. I have to play with the under 16s and over 10s when I go on a Thursday.</p>
    <p> To win the game you must win a certain amount of sets best of three for women’s matches and best of 5 sets for men’s matches. Winning a set is simply the first player to reach 6 games but have to be clear by at least 2 games. If your opponent wins 5 games you must win the set 7-5. If the set goes to 6-6 then a tie break is played and it’s simply the first player to 7 points.</p>
    <p>You need to score four points to win a game of tennis. The points are known as 15 (1 point), 30 (two points), 40 (three points) and the fourth would result in the winning point and the end of that game. If the scores went to 40-40 this would be known as deuce. When a game reaches deuce the player must then win by two clear points.</p>
