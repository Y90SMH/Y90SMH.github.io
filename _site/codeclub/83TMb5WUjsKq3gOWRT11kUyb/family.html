  <p>My family includes my mum, dad and older brother. I have at least 17-20 cousins and they are all very important to me. Me and my family are very close. I have one Nan and one Grandad I love them very much. Our family is quite big but we all stay in touch.</p>

  <p>My family is very kind they always support me through everything, they always believe in me and I am very glad to have them as my family. My Grandad is very funny he makes me laugh, my dad lets me have something when my mum says no that the only reason I love him, my mum always does homework with me, my brother lets me play on Call Of Duty and makes me smile, my Nanna Ann cooks and gardens she has the same interests as me. </p>
