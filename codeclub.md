## St Catherine of Siena

If you'd like to work on your project at home, please feel free to download [Sublime 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), but remember to bring in the files you've been working on with a Pen Drive to our next club.

## Class Projects

Your projects will be added to this site after our Website classes begin in your 2<sup>nd</sup> term, i.e after the Christmas break.
